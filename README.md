## Tasty Twist aka Zahra's Kitchen

### Description

Tasty-Twist, a recipe finder application developed as an assignment project for the module "Internet Technologies and Web Services." The spark for Tasty-Twist was ignited by our admiration for one of our most beloved lecturers, Zahra where we eventually re-named our project to Zahra's Kitchen. This project was crafted with the aim to both create and consume a SOAP service as well as to develop and utilize a REST API.
